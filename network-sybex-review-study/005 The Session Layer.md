# The Session Layer (Layer 5)
<hr>
- The Session Layer is responsible for the setup, management and teardown of a session between 2 computers. This Layer is also responsible for dialog control. Application developers must decide how their application will function with the network at this layer in respect to the network conversation.

- 3 basic forms of communication exist at this layer
	
	- Half Duplex -> A 2 way communication between 2 hosts where only 1 side can communicate at a time (Think like a walkie-talkie)
	
	- Full Duplex -> A 2 way communication between 2 hosts where both hosts can communicate at the same time. This is similar to a telephone call and it is also used for VoIP

	- Simplex -> A 1 way communication between 2 hosts. This type of communication is similar to tuning in to a radio station â€“ you do not have any control over the content or communications received
