# The Network Layer (Layer 3)
<hr>
- Layer 3 of the OSI model is responsible for the *logical addressing (Providing an IP address)* of hosts and networks. 

- The Network Layer of the OSI model is also responsible for transporting data between networks, through the process of routing.

- Routers operate at the Network Layer of the OSI model because they facilitate the movement of packets between networks

- *Internet Protocol (IP)* works at this Layer of the OSI model but it is not the only protocol that operates at this Layer. The *Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)* also operates at this Layer.

- The IP protocol at the Network Layer communicates with the Layer above by using a protocol number. The protocol number at the Network Layer helps the IP protocol move data to the next protocol
