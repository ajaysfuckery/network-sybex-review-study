# The OSI model
<hr>
- The OSI model was created to simplify and standardize the interconnection of hardware vendors

- The OSI model was created by the *Ogranization for Standardization* to standardize network connections between applications, devices and protocols

- Today the OSI Layers are used to build standards that allow for interoperability between different vendors.


# OSI model Advantages
<hr>
- The reference model helps communications between various types of hardware and software.
- The model prevents a change in one layer from affecting the other layers
- The model allows for multi-vendor development of hardware and software based on networking standards.
- The model encourages industry standardization because it defines functions of the OSI model
- The model divides a complex communications process into smaller pieces to assist with design, development and troubleshooting
- Network protocols and connectivity options can be changed without affecting applications
