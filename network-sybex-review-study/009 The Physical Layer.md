# The Physical Layer (Layer 1)
<hr>
- The Physical Layer is responsible for transmitting the data of 1s and 0s that is passed down from the Data Link Layer

- The data consisting of 1s and 0s is encoded for transmission via:
	- Radio Waves
	- Light
	- Electricity
	- Any other physical method of transmitting data

- The Physical Layer is an integral component of many different types of transmission methods. Examples: Wireless 802.11, fibre-optics and ethernet

- The Physical Layer is tied directly to the Data Link Layer, so together they are considered a macro-layer

- Hubs and Repeaters operate at the Physical Layer because they repeat the electrical signals

- The Physical Layer also defines the connection types used with the various networking technologies

- The Physical Layer is the most common place to find problems (Loose connections, bad connections)
